This is a full screen application which can be ran in RaspberryPi3. SO the whole raspberry pi can be connected to a tv and one can make a normal TV in to a smart one.

This appliocation has a inbuilt browser, with  four pre-defined urls. There is also another tab which gives you the option to browse the file sytem of the application. Files can be ran by double click on them, once double clicked then the file is loaded with the appropriate application which is installed in the pi.
